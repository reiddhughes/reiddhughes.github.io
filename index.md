## About the Author

Hello, my name is Reid Hughes.  I've been in the tech industry for about 10 years now.  I started by getting my hands dirty, literally, with warehouse robotics.  I then found an opportunity at a small startup where I jumped into the world of Python, development strategies, and AWS.  I then hopped across the river and immersed myself in DevOps, organizational design, platform engineering, and even more AWS.  Today I'm learning new languages and dreaming of ways to help others tackle DevOps and the cloud.

What's with the name *Huge Works*?  Who knows exactly when it began, but my squad of friends started calling me a play on my name: "Threid Huge".  Most likely because I can be a bit clumsy.  My father, named Ron, had a favorite shirt that just said "Iron Works".  He loved to point out, to anyone that would listen, that it actual meant "I, Ron, Works".  So there we have it: I, Threid Huge, Works (and would love to share what I've learned).
